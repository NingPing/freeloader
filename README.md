### Some kind of a story

The year is 2092. A Great Nation has taken over the world.
The world blew up in bits after the Great Nation won by using most of their nuclear arsenal. President Erbot is now the world leader
and enforces order as the last remaining military power, controlling the world's economical markets based on trading of salvaged goods.

Now people have fled the wastelands and live scattered across space and pieces of our planet that float around space.

You are a Freehauler (Freeloader). A pilot mastering the forgotten art of delivering stuff to the survivors.
Earning wealth, honor, new ships, and a crew as you go off fighting injustice and helping the weak who have survived the apocalypse.
