freehauler
==========
The year is 2092. Russians have taken over the world.
The world blew up in bits after the russians won by using most of their nuclear arsenal. President Tjerbotskj is now the world leader
and enforces order as the last remaining military power, controlling the world's economical markets based on trading of salvaged goods.

Now people have fled the wastelands and live scattered across space and pieces of our planet that float around space.

You are a Freehauler. A pilot mastering the forgotten art of delivering stuff to the survivors.
Earning wealth, honor, new ships, and a crew as you go off fighting injustice and helping the weak who have survived the apocalypse.



The furious viking, Olaf, came from another dimension. He left his dying homeworld Midgard bringing only his pet, 
the insulting messenger squirrel Ratatoskr. Olaf did not like the russians more than whats left of the people of our lost planet. 
He tries his best to help those who are left and trying to make a living.
